<p>Here's a teaser video we made when we released our wizard soccer arena:</p>

<p>Honestly, you should leave this site now and go play the game.  It'll be a lot more fun than reading this post about the game.</p>
<p>Seriously, get out of here and play it.</p>
<p>Go away.  I don't like you.</p>
<p>It looks like you're still here.  Fine.  I shall now do my best to bore you with some history.</p>
<p>I coded the first version of CodeSpells in 2012.  It sucked.  Crappy graphics.  Crappy gameplay.  And a crappy in-game Java IDE.  It also had creepy aliens for some reason:</p>
<p><img src="/user/pages/01.projects/01.codespells/oldcodespells.jpg" /></p>
<p>For some reason <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/codespells">the press loved it</a>.  I really don't know why we got so much coverage.  Maybe the creepy aliens had something to do with it?</p>
<p>Actually, I do know why.  It was because it was "science".  I was a gradaute student and <a href="/projects/phd">I wrote science papers</a> about CodeSpells.  Stuff from scientific journals always seems to find its way into mainstream news -- especially when it deals with mainstream topics like video games.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hated this prototype.  I always felt that I could do better.  Looking back at it reminds me of a time when I was a less talented game designer.</p>
<p>I'm happy to say all that's left of this prototype are some screenshots, some old news articles, and <a href="/projects/phd">some research papers</a>.</p>
<p>In 2014, I launched <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/thoughtstem/codespells-express-yourself-with-magic">a kickstarter</a> to build a new version.  I asked for $50,000.  We got $164,014 -- enough to fund the project for about two years. </p>
<p>CodeSpells has been in a playable state on Steam Early Access for much of that time.  As a business person, my philosophy is to release products ASAP and iterate.  Having a real community helps inform how to design games.</p>
<p>Our alpha and beta testers have written thousands of spells, all of which are available in-game.  If you so desired, you could write spells and publish them for other users too.  Sounds fun right?  It almost makes me wonder why you're still here.</p>
<p>Did I mention you should get out of here and <a href="http://codespells.org">go buy it</a>?  You could be a wizard with just a few clicks...</p>
<p>By the way, I was kidding back there when I said I don't like you.  Thanks for reading.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
