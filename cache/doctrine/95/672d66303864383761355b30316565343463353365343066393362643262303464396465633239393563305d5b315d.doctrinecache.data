<p>Don't think of getting a job as "deciding what to do".  Sometimes you just get a job to gain more skills so you have more options.  In fact, getting a job is a great way to <em>delay</em> the decision of "deciding what to do".</p>
<p>I learned more in 1 year at my first job than I did in 4 years of college.  I doubled my XP really quickly.  If I hadn't done that, I wouldn't have gone to grad school and I wouldn't have started a company.</p>
<p>So just do it.  You're not finalizing your career.  You're beginning it.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
