Hi.  I'm Stephen.

I'm the founder and CEO of ThoughtSTEM.  I have a masters and Ph.D. in computer science.  My passion is making software to teach people how to program.

I've launched several products in this space: learntomod.com, codespells.org, and vox-l.com.   I'm sure I'll launch many more.

You can email me at stephen [at-sign] thoughtstem [dot-thingy] com.
