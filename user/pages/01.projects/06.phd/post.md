I did several projects during my Ph.D. days at UCSD.  If you need some bedtime reading, here are the links to some of the research papers:

* An old prototype of CodeSpells (but the new one is way better).
* An IDE that can read your mind and refactor your code before you know you want to.
* A programming language that looks and feels like a Mario-style platformer. 

I wrote my thesis on paradigms for integrating coding into games.  I now run a company that does exactly that.  Weird coincidence.
