I'm the CEO and Co-Founder of ThoughtSTEM, LLC.  It is the software company through which I work on most of the projects on this site.  For example:

* [CodeSpells](/projects/codespells)
* [LearnToMod](/projects/learntomod)
* [Vox-L](/projects/vox-l)
* [The Planes](/projects/planes)

We have approximately 30 employees.

ThoughtSTEM started as a tutoring company.  We still teach hundreds of San Diego kids per year how to code.  See our main site: [thoughtstem.com](http://thoughtstem.com)
