My passion is coding education.  I teach coding for fun in my free time.

In fact, you might be here because you're one of my students and you're looking for the current homework assignment.  If so, you're in the wrong place.  If you're in my [UCSD Extension class](http://extension.ucsd.edu/studyarea/index.cfm?vAction=singleCourse&vCourse=CSE-41242), check blackboard.
