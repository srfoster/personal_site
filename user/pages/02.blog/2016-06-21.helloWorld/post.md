It's obligatory.  Hello, World!

I guess I'm starting a blog.  Let me introduce myself.  I'm Stephen.  I'm a coder.  I run a company.

I try to live a good life.  I want to make the world a better place.  I felt like it was time to start writing about how and why.

So: Hello, World!  I hope we'll be seing more of each other.
